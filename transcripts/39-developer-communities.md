developer community

is centered around the idea of nurturing and amplifying community voices within a company and the head of developer community is responsible for leading this effort. Today we're joined by Kim Maida, head of Developer Relations and community at Gatsby will discuss what her job entails the ins and outs of developer advocacy and advice for someone looking to get into

**Kelly** 0:20  
this field. Let's get started. Welcome to the ladybug podcast. I'm Kelly. I'm Ali. And I'm Emma. And we're debugging the tech industry. kendo UI is a top quality commercial UI and data visualization component library for JavaScript developers. But dozens of professional UI components for Angular, React view and jQuery ready to use out of the box. You can quickly build polished high performance responsive web apps with your technology of choice. At kendo UI. We believe developer advocacy is an effective way to connect with developers. In fact, our Kindle react Developer Advocate TJ Until recently did a webinar on creating financial dashboards in react and provided a number of tips and tricks for any developer building JavaScript apps at scale. To see what kendo UI can do, as well as how we do developer advocacy, check out the webinar@progress.co slash dev rel, that's PR, g r. s s.co. Slash d v REL. Hey, Kelly, have you heard about this cool tool called AWS amplify?

**Emma** 1:24  
Tell me about it. It's a suite of tools and services that enables developers to build full stack serverless and cloud based web and mobile apps. You get to use whichever framework or technology you want on the front end

**Kelly** 1:34  
does sounds cool. Well help me get up and running with things like hosting. Yeah, authentication. You betcha. Managed graph QL. Totally. How about serverless functions API is machine learning chatbots file storage.

Unknown Speaker 1:47  
Yes to everything. amplify is built especially in a way to enable traditionally front end developers like yourself Kelly to be successful because you can use your existing skill set to build a real world full stack apps, then the password required. knowledge around back end DevOps and scalable infrastructure. The amplify console also allows you to use a GitHub repository to deploy to a globally available CDN with ci NCD built in. It's super cool. Where can I learn more if you want to learn more about AWS amplify Miss AWS amplify.github.io. So Kim, thank you so much for joining us today. I'm super excited to get to talk with you more, because we met at all things open in Raleigh last year, but we didn't get to talk too much, unfortunately. So I'm glad you're here to talk with us today.

**Kim Maida** 2:31  
Yeah, thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Unknown Speaker 2:34  
Of course. Can you tell us a little bit more about yourself and maybe your career thus far and how you got to Gatsby? Sure.

**Kim Maida** 2:41  
So I am the head of Developer Relations and community at Gatsby before I joined Gatsby, I was actually the head of Developer Relations at authors zero. And as far as just like sort of a little bit about me, I love to travel and I like to speak to technical audiences, but I also have a young family. So That means I like to do things like cook and draw and hang out with my family. And as sort of the transition from being sort of boots on the ground developer relations to leading those types of efforts. I've gotten to spend a little bit more time doing some of the sort of more personal family stuff that that I like. And of course, the COVID-19 situation is influencing that as well, I guess.

**Emma** 3:27  
Absolutely. It's nice to hear, you know, a woman who's very, very successful and how you balance your your family life with your career, and how it's not a stigma for you. I love that. So could you tell us a little bit more about like, what does it actually mean to be the head of Developer Relations and community? What do you do today?

**Kim Maida** 3:46  
So in a general sense, I'm basically kind of like the key strategist for how a company interacts with the developers that use right now or could potentially use the product the company produces. So this is gonna differ Depending on the company, there's always nuances. But I can talk a little bit about Gatsby specifically, Gatsby's core is open source. So developer relations is basically like this intrinsic philosophy at the entire company. So a lot of companies might have sort of an enterprise product like a SaaS product or something and then they want to sort of evangelize that product to people. But at Gatsby, because the core is open source. And then we do have the cloud offering also, the the entire company is kind of involved in the devrel efforts. So it extends far beyond the devrel team. So my role at Gatsby as sort of leading this effort is more organizational. It's kind of this mix of strategy and tactical, because it's about activating and engaging the community but also providing like a cohesive strategy and I accountability and also a lot of support internally, because there are so many folks at Gatsby who are involved in dev REL activities. But that's not like their full time job, or they may not necessarily be in, in the devrel team. My job is a lot of sort of coordinating what devrel looks like across the company for anybody and everybody who wants to get involved. I think one of the most significant differences that I've come into in joining Gatsby is it I'm not the face invoices, Gatsby to the developer community, as the head of devrel. My job is more sort of strategic behind the scenes I provide. I like to kind of say it as I design an engineer the vehicle that carries other people's voices forward. So I'm probably doing a lot less speaking as sort of being the the point person of like, Oh, you know, who do I think of when I think of Gatsby. It's It's not me. And it shouldn't be me. It's my job to sort of put other people out there to be in those positions. So yeah, it's a little bit of a departure from, from what a lot of people maybe think about devrel. Like, if you think about a developer advocate, you think it's, it's the person who sort of represents the company to everybody. And it's the person whose face comes to mind when you think of the company. But that's, that's actually sort of not, not the situation, when you're kind of in a head of or lead position for, like a devrel. Team.

**Kelly** 6:38  
I love the way that you explain your role. I think it's a very important distinction as well, when you start looking into more of like a management position when you're more managing the people as opposed to the projects. I mean, it definitely plays the same kind of role here in that you're you're managing the people who are the face for developer relations for developer advocacy. So I have a question is this Difference between dev REL and dev advocacy?

**Kim Maida** 7:03  
So I, that's a super good question. I like to explain this as kind of looking at four components within Developer Relations. So basically, there's, there's like developer evangelism, there's developer advocacy, there's developer experience, and then there's community. And essentially, they're not actually all the same thing. But they're all components of Developer Relations. So you have evangelism, which is basically sort of derived from the Greek word for sharing the good word, like preaching the gospel, so to speak. You go out and share the good word about your product with developers, you say what the company's doing, and you provide information to developers to help them get the job done by using your product. And then advocacy is more along the lines of acting as the voice of the developer to the company. So you're representing the developer and their interests to the actual product and the people who are developing the product that we're offering to developers. So advocates help the community they elevate the voices of the community, both publicly and inside the company. And then they bring that feedback into the product to make it a better product. Then there's developer experience. And dev x is kind of about cultivating and enhancing and supporting the user experience when the users are developers. So we want to provide a delightful experience for anybody who's using the software product. They are developers, and this is sort of holistically developer experience. And then finally, I think you have community, which basically refers to the users of the software that you're providing. And this could be like people who are currently practitioners of it, or it could be prospective people. So people you might want to get involved in using the software, people you want to bring on board and include and sort of bring into the fold. And this especially for Gatsby might be people who are just learning to code. Or it might be like super senior architects, or it might be internal employees. There's a lot of, you know, dogfooding that goes on at companies like Gatsby and, and similar. So anybody who basically like talks about advocates or provides feedback on the product is essentially a member of the community.

**Emma** 9:24  
Can you just quickly explain what dogfooding is for those who don't know what that means?

**Kim Maida** 9:28  
Yes. So dogfooding is basically derived from eating your own dog food. It's when a company uses its own products.

**Emma** 9:36  
Yeah, absolutely. That was one of the most profound explanations that I've ever heard because I, to be honest, I always got like, I never knew what the difference was. And holy crap you're well spoken. I'm like, I mean, I knew you were well spoken, but I'm just like, even more impressed to hear that explanation. Just oh my gosh, so organized like

**Kelly** 9:58  
I do these interviews. Nearly These are the four types. Let me define each of the four types. I'm like, how do you just like do that out of your head?

**Emma** 10:05  
Well, she didn't get to where she is today without, you know, we know she's smart. It was

**Kelly** 10:10  
very impressive.

**Kim Maida** 10:12  
I know thank you, I, I'll let you in on a secret. I'm basically super super organized. Because if I don't, like stay organized and stay on top of these things, I won't have any idea what's going on. So I

**Kelly** 10:26  
my everyday life.

**Kim Maida** 10:27  
I've like defined and distill these things very precisely, like in the company documentation and documentation at previous companies so that I can sort of wrap my own head around it. And then it helps me to help other people wrap their heads around it as well.

**Emma** 10:45  
Awesome. Yeah, no, that was very insightful. And I'm glad because honestly, I don't know if there's been I haven't seen any kind of content, explaining the difference between the four. So I'm really happy that you were able to do that. So concisely now I actually understand it. I'm curious. For those listening and for myself, because I was thought developer advocacy would be something I'd be interested in. What skills vary between these four roles? What do you need to know to be successful or to get into these fields? But also like, do I need to be a software engineer before, you know moving into evangelism or advocacy?

**Kim Maida** 11:18  
Okay, so that there was like a few questions there. So if I talk about that, of the the skills involved for the four roles, I think that for many of them for advocacy, developer experience and community really, honestly, one of the biggest things is empathy. I, I want to sort of emphasize that these particular facets of devrel are really about being able to see things from other points of view, from the point of view of the users who are using the product from the points of view who have people who might even be unhappy or upset or they don't understand what the project is doing or they don't understand how to get something to work. Or they're just curious and they don't have like a background on the things that you might be talking about. evangelism is a little bit different. Because evangelism, you're basically going out and telling other people about stuff. Whereas advocacy and developer experience and community are more about sort of shaping the community and taking the feedback and making something actionable out of it for your company. But evangelism, empathy is important in the type of content that you craft. But basically, if you are going out and sort of standing on a stage or on sort of a video and telling somebody how something works, there's, it's more of I'm talking to you or at you rather than with you. It's an important component of it, but it can't stand by itself. So I think the like overall empathy, being able to talk about with people and understand their problems or concerns, or the things that make them really happy, that's like super important too, because if a computer community really loves some specific thing, then you want to amplify that. Right? You want to make sure that you're highlighting the things people are excited about. And also being able to serve people who are not excited about other things.

**Emma** 13:25  
Right? It sounds a lot. First of all, I love that answer. Because empathy is something we need to have in all aspects of software development, because everything that we do impacts our users. And users are just people and one person that springs to mind is April Wenzel, she runs compassionate coding. Yeah, sounds like a lot of this has to do with compassion. We'll link April and compassionate coding down below in the show notes. I'm curious, how would you actually build empathy into your content? Is this in regards to the language that we use to be accessible or is this maybe like defining acronyms or linking to the resources you mentioned? Is that what you're just mean by that?

**Kim Maida** 14:02  
Yeah. From a technical perspective, yes, that absolutely. Um, but it's, it's sort of more around the like, when you're communicating with people in person, like in conversation or something, or you're reaching out to developers to solicit their feedback on something, it is more sort of just about trying to see things from their point of view, and then put yourself in their shoes and say, if I was having a really hard time with this, you know, how would I want to be treated? How would I want the company to interact with me, so that they're not just like, Oh, well, you should know that. So read this doc and go away or something like that. But yes, it absolutely does include using inclusive language, basically doing things like when you're writing blog posts, if you don't say, and, and this is a simple or this should be easy or something. Because you don't want to assume that about anybody, like if I, if it's like, just npm install this and I have I have no idea what NPM is. And that's not simple for me,

**Kelly** 15:03  
that's something that I've kind of found myself, like catching myself doing as well. It's very, it's very, very easy to, like jump into like, is your think you're being like comforting by saying, Oh, this is super easy, don't worry about it. And then it ends up being difficult for the person and you don't know what their level of, you know, experiences for any of these things. So I really love that you emphasize that point. Well, what

**Emma** 15:25  
is easy, though? I mean, if we just think, what does that actually mean? It basically means you have done this before, and you know where to start with a problem. It doesn't mean that it's going to, like, I don't know, like, how do we define easy? I think that's the root of the question is like, oh, GitHub is easy to understand. Well, I struggled with get and GitHub which by the way, are two separate things. And that took me a year to learn. When people say things are easy, it's very demeaning, and it's not very empathetic. Like I love that. You mentioned empathy is the first thing because when you're creating content when you're evangelizing when you're advocating For people, we have to be very conscientious of the fact that easy means you have more experience with something and you know, where to go to debug the problem or where to find the information, but not everyone else does.

**Kim Maida** 16:13  
Yeah, absolutely. And everybody's also got their own struggles, everybody's going through something that you don't know about. And that can influence how they act, how they present themselves, and just sort of being recognizing that everybody has that is something that I think is very important when you're just conducting communications with people and trying to understand their problems from their point of view.

**Kelly** 16:40  
For sure. So I do want to loop back around because Emma asked 4 million questions I want to go, um, do you need to be a software engineer before you jump into one of these several roles?

**Kim Maida** 16:51  
That's also kind of a tricky question. I think that it sort of depends, right? It depends on the company that You're going to be doing devrel for. And it depends on what their sort of overarching devrel goals are. So if you're going to go to a company where take I'm going to use austere as an example here, off zero is very, it's an identity as a service company. So basically, they are focused on providing authentication and authorization and identity expertise to people. And while you don't have to be like an identity expert to get hired and work there, it is sort of an expectation that you become an expert over the time that you're there. And you can't very easily go and help people answer questions and sort of go stand on stage and talk about a topic if you don't understand the topic yourself. I do think that it's totally possible to go into these roles, not knowing anything about them. Technology specifics, because a lot of it is about learning on the job. So part of the one of the best strategies that I'd found in learning something was trying to teach others about it. So if I need to be able to teach it, then my, my learning of it is sort of escalated in a way where I distill it down to, like, what do I absolutely need to know? What makes this an approachable thing for other people? How can I make it approachable for myself, and then how can I relay that to other people too. So I think that in most roles at in sort of do like if you're looking for a Developer Advocate position, you can be junior and learn on the job and that that is totally fine. And in fact, it might even be ideal in many cases, because then you're learning things fresh and you have a sort of easier Just use the word easier, but you have a more comfortable time, relaying that perspective to other people. However, for some jobs, if you do need deep technical knowledge in order to answer questions and talk about it, it just helps to be at least in the field of software engineering, but then there are other companies where that's not really sort of so intrinsic to the to the company itself. So, honestly, it depends on like, kind of a cop out answer, but it does depend.

**Emma** 19:32  
And I think to like, it doesn't hurt, right? Like it helps. It's, I don't like when people are like, Oh, you have to do this to achieve, you have to do X or B x to achieve y. There's no one path And to your point, it does depend. But a lot of these jobs you can learn on the job. So I love that answer. I think that's great and kind of leading into the next question like it If someone wants to become, you know, if someone wants to join the developer relations career field, what's your advice for someone who's looking to get into that for the first time?

**Kim Maida** 20:12  
Honestly, I would say just put yourself out there. That's the first thing and sort of the biggest thing, get comfortable with creating content on things that you're passionate about. Go and talk to people. You can like start giving talks and things like that at like local meetups or apply to conferences, but you don't necessarily have to start that way. I know that that's daunting for a lot of people. It was daunting for me when I started. But you could like record a video, you can just help people in the community. You can. So again, like writing blog posts, it's like a really good one just being active on social media looking for a sec team where people are asking questions and just going in there and sort of talking to people and asking questions, if you can. This is so I was thinking about this a little while ago. And I realized I have a story that initially, I, I really thought this was off topic. But recently, I realized that it's totally related to how I got into this field. And that was like, so when I was in college, I actually got my college degree in animal behavior and neurobiology. So it was nothing to do with anything related to software engineering at all. But I was taking physics and chemistry classes, and there was this like online homework system, basically where you logged in, and there were questions that were asked of you and, and they were always like, sort of complicated multi step questions. We had to figure out what the series of things you had to do to get to the answer. And everybody in any of these courses had the same structure of question, but their numbers were all different. So you couldn't just there was a commenting system, but you couldn't just say like, oh, the answer is, you know, 25.3. But if you could figure out how to get to the answer, you could put in the comments like, here's all of the steps to get to this answer. And here's like, why each of this works. And I started doing that a lot. But I basically go through and I would figure it out. And then I would post the steps every week that they did this every week. And I would I would get like that hit of dopamine, when people people would come and say, Thank you like, this really helped me understand this, or, you know, there There were even some cases where people would be like, I'm not gonna do this until Kim posts out into it. But it was really one of those things that like it wasn't about personal glory, because nobody in the like the classes really knew who anybody else was by name. And it was all online. You don't even have a face or an icon or anything. There's no personal glory in it, but it was just about helping people to Get to their own answer. And I realized later like this is something that is really intrinsic in deveraux. And being interested in devils. So if you like to do that type of thing, I think you've already got kind of a heads up on getting into a field where where sort of the overarching goal is to help communities and build people up. And then sort of translating that way of thinking into the content you produce. And you can just do it on your own, like anybody can sign up for a dev to account super easy, like a low barrier to entry where you don't have to go and build your own blog, and then you don't have to worry about promoting it and things like that. So basically, going, going in and starting to blog is really great. People can get YouTube channels for free. You can record a couple of videos just talking about things that you're passionate about.

can even just be a couple of minutes.

**Emma** 24:02  
It's so funny because I see a lot of people who originally had foundations in the biology or the natural sciences migrate into engineering. I was one of those I started biology. And I realized pretty quickly, I was horrible at it. But I do think to some extent, it's because we have empathy to help other people from a biological perspective, like I wanted to be a doctor, I wanted to be an OB GYN my whole life, which is really a strange thing as a child to want to be. But I do think innately like we have this sense of empathy. And we realize, Oh, this actually translates into software development as well. And that's why I personally believe I don't think this is a fact. But I do think that there is a correlation between people who start out in like biology or in the natural sciences, migrating into engineering and you know, they bring the sense of empathy. It's really a wonderful thing.

**Kim Maida** 24:49  
Yeah, I see a lot of musicians too. I mean, a lot of music, former musicians.

**Emma** 24:55  
I was a professional musician. Growing up. I was a professional trumpet. A player and by professional I mean I was paid. I wasn't actually amazing. But you know, I went to the New York State honor band. But I did actually think about a career in music therapy for a while. I was not, I wasn't good enough to actually make it work. And I think my dad would have had a coronary if I had actually switched into music as a profession, because he's an engineer. So he wanted me to be an engineer. But yeah, we sell these like creative minds and empathetic minds. And they all are slowly migrating into engineering, and I love it. I would love to know what your advice is for becoming a better Developer Advocate. So like, Are there any tangible pieces so we talked about content creation, for people who perhaps are not already in Developer Relations, but for anyone who's already in developer relations are there are tangible things that you would maybe coach your dev rails on to be the best version of a developer, evangelist or like advocate

**Kim Maida** 26:00  
Yeah, so I won't repeat the the stuff about empathy again, because that's sort of like the baseline. But and so the next I want to say the somewhat delicately. But as developer advocacy has grown in the tech community, there's also this kind of growing sense of hero worship or elitism that I have seen manifests a little bit, especially for people who are sort of face and voice developer advocates. And honestly, I would try to encourage people not to get too like, attached to that, because in my opinion, overall is about helping developers and communities and providing better products. And if you can focus on those things and provide value, then that's gonna pay dividends not only to your company and community, but also to you hopefully you are one of those people who likes to help people for the sake of making things better, rather than sort of being on the pedestal and having Oh, I flew You know, X number of countries and spoke on X number of stages this year. Like while all of that is fun and great, I would love to see sort of the advocacy community move away from that a little bit and move more towards How can we elevate voices in the community, for example, how can we get other people onto the stage? How can we get other people's content out there? How can we sort of facilitate learning with the programs that we provide rather than being sort of this? You know, epic jetsetter, who's you know, all of the devil emails are from this person. So they're now famous as being the representative of x company. And I would love to see that sort of just go back into channeling support for community voices.

Unknown Speaker 27:49  
I love

**Kim Maida** 27:51  
so

**Emma** 27:52  
much, I because in all honesty, this is something I've thought about subconsciously but I've never actually discussed this and I mean, we touched on some things on our personal burning episode where we discuss how we create a content and got followers.

But I feel like people look at, you know, anyone on listening, Twitter, for example, anyone on Twitter with a large following, they look at that and they look at, I get to go to speak at conferences, and I'm not saying that I'm not privileged, I am privileged, I will be the first person to admit that, and I'm very grateful. But it also comes with some negatives, right? Like, if you just think that you're going to get into Developer Relations or evangelism, and fly to conferences, and everything is going to be great and dandy and everyone's going to follow you and it's going to be wonderful. Just don't forget that there are also negatives to that. It's the constant need to feel attached to your phone all the time. It's that takes a toll on your mental health. It's being able to accept constructive criticism that sometimes just difficult to hear, maybe it's just criticism. It's having to be a little bit more careful with how you choose to express your opinions online because you're impacting so many more people. So there are a lot of things that go along with it. evangelism and traveling to conferences like you have to be okay being away from your family for long periods of time and traveling across time zones and losing sleep. So don't get into developer relations for the things that you think are benefits get into it, because you genuinely have a desire to help people to come to Kim's point.

**Kim Maida** 29:17  
Yeah, 100% I, I definitely I know, it can be very tempting for a lot of people to say, Well, I'm going to use this as a springboard to become famous, basically. But if you want to be really good at Developer Relations, if all you're thinking about is becoming famous, you're not going to end up being a good developer advocate, in the ways that are meaningful

**Emma** 29:40  
relations is almost short for relationships, which is what you should be curating is relationships, not follower numbers, like you shouldn't be so obsessed with the actual data of people following you versus how many relationships have you cultivated? How big is your network do actually enjoy doing these things?

**Kelly** 29:56  
Yes, I completely agree. So I'm curious. Guess where do you see this field going? And then like in the near future, not not counting Coronavirus. We'll get to that afterwards. But right just like in general terms, like where do you see this bill going?

**Kim Maida** 30:11  
I see it continuing to grow probably by a lot. Again, I'm sort of pretending Coronavirus at the moment. Coronavirus may actually have a huge impact on this. But I think we can talk about that in a minute. As in general, as a field, I see it continuing to grow exponentially because it's already doing that. It's still relatively new as a field. But I The thing that I also see and kind of hoped for is a lot of expansion beyond metrics. So one of the things that's notorious about devrel is that it's hard to measure. So you can you can have like vanity metrics, like how many people were physically present in the room when you stood on a stage and gave a talk. But that doesn't necessarily mean that they weren't playing on their phone the whole time. It doesn't mean they're paying attention doesn't mean that they're going To engage with you or the product afterwards. So learning how to sort of track things like meaningful interactions is one of the big conversations around devrel right now, and I see that getting refined a lot. As the field grows as more people get into it. And I, from a personal standpoint, I really hope that sort of the elitism and drive for hero worship decreases as the, the breadth of the field increases. I would love to see that too. I, I mean, just, it could be something hard what you deem is harmless like putting, you know, people with a bunch of Twitter followers like putting their names on a T shirt. These kinds of things, while they seem harmless actually do have negative implications in the sense that, you know, if you're not careful, we're lifting up voices that are all homogenous, they don't have accurate diversity representation and this can be harmful to to the industry. I second that I At the end of the day, we're all humans and anyone who, who I've gotten messages, it's like, oh, like, I'm so excited. You responded to my tweet and like, I'm just a person. Like, I think people forget that. We're just people. And I and I would hope that as this industry grows again, this hero worship diminishes. Yeah. And it's about like us leveraging that platform for the people do have that platform. It's about leveraging that platform to elevate other people's voices, who are sort of less homogenous, more diverse, increasing. I love that.

**Emma** 32:29  
I love that. Let's make it what is the word conglomerate? Now? That's not the right word. Is that there? When all like, you know what I mean? Not a conglomerate, when a when you have like different shapes and sizes of things. So opposite of homogenous does anyone own talking about? No, I'm losing my English, the longer I live in Europe. In any case, it doesn't matter. This is not a vocabulary. So my last question for you, as you know, we're living through a very terrible pandemic. That's gonna To change the way that we work, and I'm just curious how that impacts your day to day,

**Kim Maida** 33:04  
I've actually seen myself and also a lot of other people who I talked to often about the same thing get busier, not less busy, which is very interesting, actually, at the outset, because you you think of maybe jobs as advocates to as going out and speaking and things like that. And we can't do the in person events anymore. So then what are you doing, but it's really been a lot about, like conferences going virtual or they get cancelled or rescheduled, but most of my job personally is centered around strategy and program building and removing blockers. And this type of thing has little to do with like going out and speaking. So for me, it hasn't changed significantly. Like I've actually had a lot more time to do that, which means I've gotten a lot busier doing that. For other folks in the devrel space, it's increased their workload in that virtual conferences, and events like that. They required just as much prep as in person events, but they don't require the travel aspect. So the expectation from, you know, external pressures that your company might be a well, you can do a lot, a lot of virtual events, because you have less travel time. But this actually increases workload and then people are sort of thinking, well, I need to, you know, get out blog content, I need to get videos going, I need to stream I need to spin up a podcast and all of these things are sort of landing all at once, because we aren't doing as much traveling and visiting people in person. And so people sort of are feeling a lot of pressure to be even busier than usual, which somewhat unexpected, but also interesting.

**Emma** 34:51  
Absolutely. Yeah, I you know, I've thoroughly enjoyed this conversation. I learned so much about a field that I thought I knew a decent amount about and I'm coming to realize I did not know a lot about it. So I'm thrilled that you, you know, gave us your time you donated your time to us to, to educate our community. And I thank you for that. I

**Kelly** 35:11  
yeah, I completely agree. I knew pretty much nothing about developer advocacy, Developer Relations going into this. And now I know that there's actually a difference between all of these different types of dev REL. So I'm really excited for for this episode to go live just because I think everything that you've provided us information wise, like we don't usually take notes, when we're interviewing people. And we have so many notes to just like, include in our show notes and everything, just to kind of expand on this. This topic. So yeah, thank you. Thank you again, like, there's another

**Emma** 35:46  
there's another cool I can take from Kim and blast out to Twitter. So insightful. Before I turn it over to you, Kelly to segue into our last bit, I just want to announce that conglomerate was the right word. I didn't think it was so Everyone's going to learn what this word means today because it's a great word. But basically, it's a thing consisting of a number of different and distinct parts grouped together. So it's typically used with geology, which is how I learned it. It's a coarse grained rock with different rounded fragments, but it can be used to discuss things that are anti homogenous. In our case, hopefully, the software engineering industry becomes more conglomerate and more differentiated with different and more diverse pieces. So that is your word of the day. With that, Kelly, I'm gonna let you segue that was beautiful. Thank you for teaching me over.

**Kelly** 36:33  
Yes, so we like to end these episodes with a shout out. So this could be anything from a book you've been reading or a person who published some really cool content, or the food you ate yesterday. I mean, it can literally be anything. So Emma, I want you to kick things off with with your shout out.

**Emma** 36:50  
Sure. So my shout out is gonna go to a new website slash ebook that I'm working on. I woke up at 6am this morning and decided I wanted to write an E book which is insane. So normal So I built it, I built it actually, I built a Gatsby website this morning and just an hour that shows you how easy Gatsby is. And so it's called technical interviews, dot Dev, we'll link it in the show notes. But essentially, it's just an E book, I'm gonna be doing them pay which you wish model. So it's accessible for anybody. And it will just contain all of my knowledge about technical interviews, and I've done a lot of them and I failed at a lot of them. But I've also succeeded at quite a few. So that is my shout out for the day. How about you can

**Kim Maida** 37:29  
I would basically like to shout out to everyone who's sort of getting through this pandemic, but specifically, people who are kind of going above and beyond so I work with Dana Jones, who is an engineering manager for core at Gatsby, so she manages engineers who work on the open source. And not only is she like doing PR for views and getting through all of that and sort of knocking it out of the park but she's also making masks on On the side, and she is also still hiring. So definitely like people who are working really hard at both, you know, helping the the teammates that they work with, and then also helping the general public, like hats off to to those people for sure.

**Kelly** 38:18  
I love that. I am going to give my shout out to my husband, because we've been adjusting to working from home together. And I love spending all my time with him. I think the most difficult part is the fact that we both have a lot of meetings, it turns out and we both work in the same room. So we are often one of us is like walking around with our bluetooth headphones. So we're not talking over one or the other. Or like in this case, I'm recording a podcast episode so my husband is downstairs holding his meetings because I need silence. So I very much appreciate him adjusting with me to this Beautiful work from home life and also eating a lot of spaghetti.
