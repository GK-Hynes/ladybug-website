description: "Interviewing is hard, and while we all probably focus primarily on the technical interviews, the behavioral interviews can make or break your success. In two previous episodes we discussed data structures and algorithms as well as the frontend technical interview process. This week we’re covering the behavioral and cultural side of interviews - essentially the rest of the interview that doesn’t include the technical questions."

AWS Amplify is a suite of tools and services that enables developers to build full stack serverless and cloud-based web and mobile apps using their framework or technology of choice on the front end.

Using Amplify you can quickly get up and running with things like hosting, authentication, managed GraphQL, serverless functions, APIs, machine learning, chat bots, and storage for files like images, videos, and pdfs.

Amplify is built especially in a way to enable traditionally front-end developers to be successful because they can use their existing skillset to build real-world full stack apps that in the past would require deep knowledge around back end, dev ops, and scalable infrastructure.

The Amplify Console then allows you to use a Github repository to deploy to a globally available CDN, with CI and CD built in.
